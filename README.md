# <u>COVID-19-DETECTION-USING-CNN</u>

### **DESCRIPTION**
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for assisting in the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, particularly in situations where access to PCR tests or medical experts is limited.

### **KEY FEATURES**
- **CNN architecture**: The model utilizes a deep learning architecture based on convolutional neural networks, which have proven to be effective in image classification tasks.
- **Data preprocessing**: The repository includes code for preprocessing chest X-ray images, including resizing, normalization, and augmentation techniques to enhance the performance and generalization of the model.
- **Training and evaluation**: The model is trained using a large dataset of chest X-ray images, including both COVID-19 positive and negative cases. The training process is implemented with appropriate optimization algorithms and loss functions. Evaluation metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are computed to assess the performance of the model.
- **Model deployment**: Once trained, the model can be deployed for real-time COVID-19 detection on new, unseen chest X-ray images. The repository provides scripts or instructions for using the model in a production environment.
- **Performance analysis**: The repository includes tools and scripts for analyzing the performance of the model, such as generating confusion matrices, ROC curves, and precision-recall curves.
