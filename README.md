# COVID-19-DETECTION-USING-CNN

## DESCRIPTION
This GitHub repository contains an implementation of a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) model for detecting COVID-19 from chest X-ray images. The goal of this project is to provide a reliable and efficient tool for assisting in the diagnosis of COVID-19 cases, particularly in situations where access to PCR tests or medical experts is limited.
